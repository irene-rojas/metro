This app uses WMATA's API <a href="https://developer.wmata.com/">Developer Portal</a> to display expected railcar arrival times at Metro stations. Select a station and you will see the estimated arrival times of trains travelling in certain directions, as well as the line color and number of cars. It may not show details for end-of-line stations. This is known issue with the WMATA API. 

It uses fonts from the Metro style guide and colors from the website in spring 2019. The app looks best on a mobile device.
